<h2>THE NON-CAPITALIST'S VADE MECUM.</h2>

<p><i>Question.</i> Having no cash you wish to make a living. Kindly
tell me the objections to sweeping a crossing?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> A small sum of money would be necessary to purchase
a broom&mdash;a preliminary step that could not be surmounted.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Quite so. And would a like difficulty arise to prevent
you selling lucifers?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Certainly, for matches suitable for street hawking cannot
be obtained on credit.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Would a clerkship be within your reach?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Scarcely, as a new suit, or a nearly new suit of clothes
would be requisite to give one the air of respectability necessary for
securing an audience with an employer.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Could you not become a company promoter?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Not with safety, now that the winding-up business is
superintended by a judge capable of understanding the intricacies of
city finance.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is there any opening for you as a cab-driver?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No, as a license cannot be obtained for love, but must be
bought with money.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Surely you have a chance as a slave to journalism?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Writing for the press is at all times precarious, and is,
moreover, a calling which cannot be followed without a small but
impossible expenditure on pens, ink. and paper.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Has not life sometimes been supported by the successful
attempts to borrow from one's friends?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes, but this financial condition will have been enjoyed
and abandoned before one can truthfully style oneself an
ex-capitalist.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> The sale of information of an interesting character to
those concerned has sometimes&mdash;has it not&mdash;been found of a profitable
nature?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Occasionally, but this again is not only an unpleasant
but a dangerous operation, and if resisted, may end with an entirely
embarrassing prosecution at the Old Bailey.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Then having no cash, no credit, and no references, what
career is open to you?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> But one&mdash;to become the responsible manager of a
theatrical company touring in the provinces.</p>

<hr />

<p>"<span class="smcap">Tempora Mutantur.</span>"&mdash;In these days of
very late dining hours a performance at 5
<span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, if over at 7, or 7.15 at latest,
ought to suit those whose daily work is over about 4 or 4.30, and who
dislike "turning out" after dinner if they are at home, and who cannot
get away from any dinner party if they are out in time to see even
half of the entertainment. The <i>matin√©e</i> at two is a very
difficult time, as it clashes with lunch; but as tea can be taken in
the <i>entr'actes</i>, five o'clock seems a very reasonable hour, that
is, if the show be over at 7.15, and the dinner hour be 8 or 8.15.</p>

<h2 class="sans">HINTS TO SKATERS ON ETIQUETTE AND DEPORTMENT.</h2>

<p>Do not venture on the ice until you can skate properly. Practice
the various steps and evolutions before a looking-glass in your
bed-room.</p>

<p>There is a great art in falling gracefully, and it is surprising
what a number of interesting, complicated, and unlooked-for attitudes
and figures can be thus developed. To ensure perfect confidence at the
critical moment, it is as well to hire somebody, say a professional
wrestler or prize-fighter, to trip you up and knock you down in all
the possible methods. A mattress may be used for beginners to fall on.
The more improbable your manner of tumbling, the greater success will
you achieve in the eyes of the on-lookers.</p>

<p>When skating with a lady, you may cross hands, but it is unusual
for you to put your arm round her waist. This is only done in great
emergencies, or in a thick fog, or when you have the pond to
yourselves. It is generally found that this proceeding is equivalent
to skating on very thin ice, and will lead to dangerous
consequences.</p>

<p>If, however, a lady, who evidently has not complete control of
herself, and does not readily answer her helm, steers straight into
your arms, you should accept the situation in your best ball-room
manner. Do not attempt to avoid a collision, as if you dodge suddenly,
the lady, on failing to meet your support, will probably sit down
abruptly on the ice, or get entangled with a sweeper.</p>

<p>Should you, owing to any unforeseen circumstance, find yourself
prostrated at a young lady's feet, do not place your hand on your
heart and say she is the only girl you ever loved. These little
scenes are apt to collect a crowd. Merely say you stopped to examine
the thickness of the ice, or any little <i>plaisanterie</i> you feel
capable of inventing. Then retire to a discreet distance and rub
yourself.</p>

<p>If the ice gives way, and you find yourself in the water, get out
as speedily as possible. I do not advise drowning. It is always a wet
and uncomfortable process, and has very few recommendations. It is,
moreover, quite fatal to true enjoyment, and only those who are
morbidly anxious for a "par" in the papers will habitually resort to
this mode of creating a sensation.</p>

<p>Do not hit people much with any stick you may think it <i>de
rigueur</i> to brandish about. Such personal attentions are best
performed when you and a string of ten or twelve other 'Arries are
banded together. You can then stand up without fear for the rights of
the high-spirited young citizen to enjoy himself.</p>

<p>There is nothing that figure-skaters so much appreciate as the
sudden inroad of hockey-players in their midst. It adds immensely to
their zest to feel they are liable to be knocked over in the middle
of an exciting "rocker" or "mohawk"; and, of course, they like their
combined figures to be nicely disarranged, as it enables them to show
their skill in sorting themselves again. Hockey should therefore be
indulged in anywhere and everywhere.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you prefer sliding to skating, do not slide in a top-hat
and frock-coat, unless you are a member of the Skating Club, and even
then it looks ostentatious. Dress appropriately in some quiet costume
of kickseys and pearlies, with a feather in your hat. Wear your
billycock at the back of your head, as it will break your falls.
Always shout at the top of your voice.</p>

<h2>THE SEVERE WEATHER.</h2>

<p class="titleit">(From Mr. Punch's Very Special Correspondents.)</p>

<p>Reports from all parts of the country are eloquent of the
phenomenal nature of the weather experienced everywhere. By an
extraordinary coincidence, of which it is hardly possible to make too
much, the intense cold has been accompanied by a lowness of
temperature&mdash;on the (Fahren) height.</p>

<p>The Oldest Inhabitant has had a high old time, and been in immense
form. To prevent the extinction in future years of this interesting
individual, oxen have been roasted freely, and, wherever at all
practicable, carriages have been driven over frozen rivers.
Occasionally irreverent descendants have roasted the Oldest
Inhabitant.</p>

<p>It is reported, on the authority of Lord
<span class="smcap">Salisbury</span>, that the Liberal Party intend at
once to engage in snowballing the House of Lords. As the ex-Prime
Minister has promised to play the game with no lack of mutuality,
interesting developments are expected.</p>

<p>A very remarkable occurrence comes from abroad&mdash;considerations of
an international character make it advisable not to particularise
further. A bishop went out in the middle of a raging blizzard.
Although the bishop was suitably attired in episcopal dress, so that
no mistake as to his identity was possible, it went on blizzarding,
and the spiritual dignitary was put to extreme temporal temporary
inconvenience.</p>

<p>Ice floes have penetrated to London Bridge. Mr.
<span class="smcap">Seymour Hicks's</span> topical song in the <i>Shop
Girl</i>&mdash;"Oh, floe! ice and snow, you know"&mdash;is received every night
with even greater enthusiasm than formerly.</p>

<p>The following letter will <span class="smcap">NOT</span> appear in
an early number of <i>The Spectator</i>:&mdash;</p>

<h3>ANIMAL SAGACITY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I desire to draw your
attention to what I think I may fairly describe as a wonderful
instance of animal sagacity. During the recent severe frost a large
number of birds and rabbits were fed every day in my garden. On
Friday, for the first time, I noticed a fine hare, which, from its
appearance, evidently felt the cold bitterly. I fed it, but shivering
set in, and pained by its suffering (for I have a kind heart) I took
it into the kitchen. Half-an-hour afterwards the cook came to tell me
that the kitchen-maid was in hysterics. I went down and found out the
reason&mdash;the girl had been frightened, when taking up a large jug which
stood on the ground, to find the hare in it! The hare, poor thing,
preferred a warm death to a cold existence, but, denied the
possibility of human speech, had taken this graphic way of indicating
its wishes. I have only to add that they were respected at dinner
yesterday.</p>

<p class="title1">THE THIRD ACT.</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>An elevation and rockery in</i>
<span class="smcap">Fr&uuml;yseck's</span> <i>back-garden, from
which&mdash;but for the houses in between&mdash;an extensive view over the
steamer-pier and fiord could be obtained. In front, a summer-house,
covered with creepers and wild earwigs. On a bench outside</i>,
<span class="smcap">Mopsa</span> <i>is sitting. She has the inevitable
little travelling-bag on a strap over her shoulder.</i>
<span class="smcap">Blochdr&auml;hn</span> <i>comes up in the dusk.
He, too, has a travelling-bag, made of straw, containing professional
implements, over his shoulder. He is carrying a rolled-up handbill and
a small paste-pot.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>Sanitary Engineer Blochdr&auml;hn</i> (<i>catching sight of</i>
<span class="smcap">Mopsa's</span> <i>handbag</i>). So you really
<i>are</i> off at last? So am I. <i>I</i>'m going by train.</p>

<p><i>Mopsa</i> (<i>with a faint smile</i>). Are you? Then <i>I</i>
take the steamer. Have you seen <span class="smcap">Alfred</span>
anywhere about&mdash;or <span class="smcap">Spreta</span>?</p>

<p><i>San. Eng. Bloch.</i> I have been seeing a good deal of
<i>Mrs.</i> <span class="smcap">Fr&uuml;yseck</span>. She asked me to
come up here and paste one of these handbills on the summer-house. To
offer a reward for Little <span class="smcap">Mops&euml;man</span>,
you know. I've been sticking them up everywhere. (<i>Busied with the
paste-pot.</i>) But you'll see&mdash;he'll never turn up.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;"><a href="images/076.png"><img src="images/076-400.png" width="400" height="346" alt="It takes two to connect the ventilating shaft...." /></a>
<p>"It takes two to connect the ventilating shaft with the main drainage."</p>
</div>

<p><i>Mopsa</i> (<i>sighing</i>). Poor
<span class="smcap">Spreta</span>! and oh, poor <i>dear</i>
<span class="smcap">Alfred</span>! I really don't know if I <i>can</i>
have the heart to leave him.</p>

<p><i>San. Eng. Bloch.</i> (<i>pasting up the bill</i>). I shall not
believe it myself until I actually see you <i>do</i> it. But why
shouldn't you come along with me, if you <i>are</i> going&mdash;h'm?</p>

<p><i>Mopsa.</i> If you were only a married man&mdash;but I have to be so
careful <i>now</i>, you know!</p>

<p><i>San. Eng. Bloch.</i> It tortures me to think of our two handbags
each taking its own way; it really does, Miss
<span class="smcap">Mopsa</span>. And then for me to have to plumb all
by myself. Though, to be sure, one can always get round the district
surveyor alone.</p>

<p><i>Mopsa.</i> Ah, yes, <i>that</i> you can surely manage alone.</p>

<p><i>San. Eng. Bloch.</i> But it takes two to connect the ventilating
shaft with the main drainage.</p>

<p><i>Mopsa</i> (<i>looking up at him</i>). Always two? Never more?
Never many?</p>

<p><i>San. Eng. Bloch.</i> Well, then, you see, it becomes quite a
different matter&mdash;it cuts down the profits. But are you sure you can
never make up your mind to share my great new job with me?</p>

<p><i>Mopsa.</i> I tried that once&mdash;with
<span class="smcap">Alfred</span>. It didn't quite answer&mdash;though it
was delightful, all the same.</p>

<p><i>San. Eng. Bloch.</i> Then there really <i>has</i> been a bright
and happy time in your life? I should never have suspected it!</p>

<p><i>Mopsa.</i> Oh yes, you can't think how amusing
<span class="smcap">Alfred</span> was in those days. When he
distinguished himself by failing to pass his examinations, and then,
from time to time, when he lost his post in some school or other, or
when his big, bulky manuscripts were declined by some magazine&mdash;with
thanks!</p>

<p><i>San. Eng. Bloch.</i> Yes, I can quite see that such an existence
must have had its moments of quiet merriment. (<i>Shaking his
head.</i>) But I <i>don't</i> see what in the world possessed
<span class="smcap">Alfred</span> to go and marry as he did.</p>

<p><i>Mopsa</i> (<i>with suppressed emotion</i>). The Law of Change.
Our latest catchphrase, you know. <span class="smcap">Alfred</span> is
so subject to it. So will <i>you</i> be, some day or other!</p>

<p><i>San. Eng. Bloch.</i> Never in all my life; whatever progress may
be made in sanitation! (<i>Insistently.</i>) Can't you <i>really</i>
care for me?</p>

<p><i>Mopsa.</i> I might&mdash;(<i>looking down</i>)&mdash;if you have no
objection to go halves with <span class="smcap">Alfred</span>.</p>

<p><i>San. Eng. Bloch.</i> I am behind the times, I daresay; but such
an arrangement does <i>not</i> strike me as a firm basis for a really
happy home. I should certainly object to it, most decidedly.</p>

<p><i>Mopsa</i> (<i>laughs bitterly</i>). What creatures of convention
you men are, after all! (<i>Recollecting herself.</i>) But I
<i>quite</i> forgot. I am conventional <i>myself</i> now. You are
perfectly right; it <i>would</i> be utterly irregular!</p>

<p><i>Alfred</i> (<i>comes up the steps</i>). Is it you,
<span class="smcap">Blochdr&auml;hn</span>, that has posted up that
bill? On the new summer-house!</p>

<p><i>San. Eng. Bloch.</i> Yes, Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Fr&uuml;yseck</span> asked me to.</p>

<p><i>Alfred</i> (<i>touched</i>). Then she <i>does</i> miss Little
<span class="smcap">Mops&euml;man</span>, after all! Are you going?
Not without <i><span class="smcap">Mopsa?</span></i></p>

<p><i>San. Eng. Bloch.</i> (<i>shaking his head</i>). I did invite her
to accompany me; but she won't. So I must make my jobs alone.</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> It's so horrible to be alone&mdash;or <i>not</i> to be
alone, if it comes to that! (<i>Oppressed&mdash;to himself.</i>) My troll
is at it again! I shall press her to stay&mdash;I <i>know</i> I shall&mdash;and
it will end in the usual way!</p>

<p><i>Spreta</i> (<i>comes up the steps, plaintively</i>). It
<i>is</i> unkind of you all to leave me alone like this. When I'm so
nervous in the dark, too!</p>

<p><i>Mopsa</i> (<i>tenderly</i>). But I <i>must</i> leave you,
<span class="smcap">Spreta</span>, dear. By the next steamer. That
is&mdash;&mdash;Well, I really <i>ought</i> to!</p>

<p><i>Alfred</i> (<i>almost inaudibly, hitting himself on the
chest</i>). Down, you little beggar, down! No, it's no use; the troll
<i>will</i> keep popping up! (<i>Aloud</i>) Can't we persuade you,
dear <span class="smcap">Mopsa</span>? Do stay&mdash;just to keep
<span class="smcap">Spreta</span> company, you know!</p>

<p><i>Mopsa</i> (<i>as if struggling with herself</i>). Oh, I want to
so much! I'd do <i>anything</i> to oblige dear
<span class="smcap">Spreta</span>!</p>

<p><i>San. Eng. Bloch.</i> (<i>to himself, dejectedly</i>). She is
just like that Miss <span class="smcap">Hilda Wangel</span> for making
herself so perfectly at home!</p>

<p><i>Spreta</i> (<i>resignedly</i>). Oh, <i>I</i> don't mind. After
all, I would rather <span class="smcap">Alfred</span> philandered than
fretted and fussed here alone with me. You had better stay, and be our
Little <span class="smcap">Mops&euml;man</span>. It will keep
<span class="smcap">Alfred</span> quiet&mdash;and that's
<i>something</i>!</p>

<p><i>Mopsa.</i> No; it was only a temporary lapse. I keep on
forgetting that I am no longer an emotional Cuckoo heroine. I am
perfectly respectable. And I will prove it by leaving with Mr.
<span class="smcap">Blochdr&auml;hn</span> at once&mdash;if he will be so
obliging as to escort me?</p>

<p><i>San. Eng. Bloch.</i> Delighted, my dear Miss
<span class="smcap">Mopsa</span>, at so unexpected a bit of good luck.
We've only just time to catch the steamer.</p>

<p><i>Mopsa.</i> Then, thanks so much for a quite <i>too</i>
delightful visit, <span class="smcap">Spreta</span>. So <i>sorry</i>
to have to run away like this! (<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Alfred</span>, <i>with subdued anguish</i>.) I am
running away&mdash;from <i>you</i>! I <i>entreat</i> you not to follow
me&mdash;not <i>just</i> yet, at any rate!</p>

<p><i>Alfred</i> (<i>shrinking back</i>). Ah! (<i>To himself.</i>) If
it depends upon our two trolls whether&mdash;&mdash;.
(<span class="smcap">Mopsa</span> <i>goes off with</i> Sanitary
Engineer <span class="smcap">Blochdr&auml;hn</span>.) There's the
steamer, <span class="smcap">Spreta</span>.... By Jove, they'll have a
run for it! Look, she's putting in.</p>

<p><i>Spreta.</i> I daren't. The steamer has one red and one green
eye&mdash;just like <span class="smcap">Mops&euml;man's</span> at
mealtimes!</p>

<p><i>Alfred</i> (<i>common-sensibly</i>). Only her lights, you know.
She doesn't mean anything <i>personal</i> by it.</p>

<p><i>Spreta.</i> But they're actually mooring her by the very pier
that&mdash;&mdash;How can they have the <i>heart!</i></p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> Steamboat companies have no feelings. Though why
<i>you</i> should feel it so, when you positively loathed the dog.</p>

<p><i>Spreta.</i> After all, you weren't so particularly fond of him
yourself; now <i>were</i> you, <span class="smcap">Alfred</span>?</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> H'm, he was a decent dog enough&mdash;for a mongrel. I
didn't <i>mind</i> him; now you <i>did</i>.</p>

<p><i>Spreta</i> (<i>nods slowly</i>). There is a change in me now. I
am easier to please. I could share you with the mangiest mongrel, if I
were only quite sure you would never again want to follow that minx
<span class="smcap">Mopsa</span>,
<span class="smcap">Alfred</span>!</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> I never said I <i>did</i> want to; though I can't
answer for the troll. But I must go away <i>somewhere</i>&mdash;I'm such a
depressing companion for you. I shall go away up into the
solitudes&mdash;which reminds me of an anecdote I never told either you or
<span class="smcap">Mopsa</span> before. Sit down and I will tell it
you.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span></p>

<p><i>Spreta</i> (<i>timidly</i>). Not the one about the night of
terror you had on the mountains, <span class="smcap">Alfred</span>,
when you lost your way and couldn't find a policeman anywhere about
the peaks? Because I've heard <i>that</i>&mdash;and I don't think I
<i>can</i> stand it again.</p>

<p><i>Alfred</i> (<i>coldly and bitterly</i>). You see that I have
really nothing to fill up my life with, when my own wife refuses to
listen to my anecdotes! Now <span class="smcap">Mopsa</span>
always&mdash;&mdash; What is all that barking down there in the town?</p>

<p><i>Spreta</i> (<i>with an outburst</i>). Oh, you'll see, they've
found Little <span class="smcap">Mops&euml;man</span>!</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> Not they. He'll <i>never</i> be found. Those
handbills of yours were a mere waste of money. It is only the curs
fighting in the street&mdash;as usual.</p>

<p><i>Spreta</i> (<i>slowly, and with resolution</i>). Only that,
<span class="smcap">Alfred</span>. And do you know what I mean to do,
as soon as you are away solitudinising up there in the mountain
hotels? I will go down and bring all those poor neglected dogs home
with me.</p>

<p><i>Alfred</i> (<i>uneasily</i>). What&mdash;the whole <i>lot</i> of
them, <span class="smcap">Spreta</span>? (<i>Shocked.</i>) In our
Little <span class="smcap">Mops&euml;man's</span> place!</p>

<p><i>Spreta</i> (<i>firmly and decidedly</i>). Every one. To fill
Little <span class="smcap">Mops&euml;man's</span> place. They shall
dig up his bones, lie on his mat, take it in turns to sleep in his
basket. I will try to&mdash;h'm&mdash;lighten and ennoble their lot in life.</p>

<p><i>Alfred</i> (<i>with growing uneasiness</i>). When you simply
detest all dogs! I don't know <i>anyone</i> less fitted than you to
manage a Dog's Home. I really don't!</p>

<p><i>Spreta.</i> I must fill the void in my life <i>somehow</i>&mdash;if
you go and leave me. And I must educate myself to <i>understand</i>
dogs better, that's all.</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> Yes, that you would <i>have</i> to do. (<i>As if
struck with an idea.</i>) Before you <i>begin</i>. Suppose I take up
my big fat book on <i>Canine Idiosyncrasy</i> once more, eh? That
would teach you how to purify and ennoble every poodle really
scientifically, you know. Only you must promise to wait till I've got
it <i>done</i>.</p>

<p><i>Spreta</i> (<i>with a melancholy smile</i>). I am in no hurry
<span class="smcap">Alfred</span>. Only to write that you would have
to remain at home.</p>

<p><i>Alfred</i> (<i>half evasively</i>). Not necessarily. I
<i>might</i>, of course&mdash;for a while, that is. But I shall have many a
heavy day of work before me, <span class="smcap">Spreta</span>, and
you will see, now and then perhaps, a great slumberous peace descend
on me as I toil away in my brown study&mdash;but I shall be making
wonderful progress all the same.</p>

<p><i>Spreta.</i> I shall quite understand <i>that</i>,
<span class="smcap">Alfred</span>. Oh, dear, who in the world's
this?</p>

<p class="right">[The <span class="smcap">Varmint-Bl&otilde;k</span>
<i>appears mysteriously in the gloom</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Varmint-Bl&otilde;k.</i> Excuse me, Captin, and your sweet

it might so happen that you'd been advertising the very identical dawg

<h2 class="sans">TALL TALES OF SPORT AND ADVENTURE.</h2>

<p class="titleit">(By Mr. Punch's own Short Story-teller.)</p>

<p class="title">I.&mdash;THE PINK HIPPOPOTAMUS. (continued.)</p>

<p>I ought to mention that the Ranee, the aunt of my darling
<span class="smcap">Chuddah</span>, was as susceptible as she was
haughty and ferocious. During my stay in the capital I had had several
interviews with her, and I could not disguise from myself&mdash;why should
I?&mdash;that she regarded me with no common favour. Indeed, she had taken
the somewhat extreme step of informing me semi-officially (so that she
might afterwards, if necessary, be at liberty to disavow it) that, if
I would only consent to marry her, she would undertake to poison Sir
<span class="smcap">Bonamy Battlehorn</span>. I should thus be
elevated not only to the supreme command of the British forces, but
also to the throne of the Diamond City. But I withstood her
blandishments, captivated, as I was, by the tender maidenly loveliness
of <span class="smcap">Chuddah</span>, and the wicked old woman had
sworn to have her revenge. I had, of course, a staunch ally in her
brother, the <span class="smcap">Meebhoy</span>, but in his disabled
condition, that veteran warrior could be of little real use to me.
Still he knew of my love for his niece
<span class="smcap">Chuddah</span>, and, knowing all my worth, he had
already consecrated with his blessing our prospective union. On this
particular evening I found <span class="smcap">Chuddah</span> in her
cosy little boudoir alone, save for the presence of her stout and
comfortable old Ayah or Nana. The darling girl sprang up as I entered
the room and threw herself into my arms in a passion of affection. I
gently disengaged her arms from about my neck, and proceeded, as best
I could, to inform her that I had come to take leave of her for a
short time. Her grief was terrible to witness.</p>

<p>"Oh, my own!" she sobbed (I translate her language); "my very, very
own, my tall and gorgeously beautiful son of the fair-faced English,
my moon of radiant splendour, my star of aspiring hope, say not thou
art come to say farewell, say it not my dearest Duffadar, for
<span class="smcap">Chuddah</span> cannot bear it."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;"><a href="images/081-3.png"><img src="images/081-3-350.png" width="350" height="361" alt="Hist! What is that sound?" /></a>
<p>"Hist! What is that sound?"</p>
</div>

<p>"But, my darling," I urged, "duty calls, and
<span class="smcap">Chuddah</span> would not have her
<span class="smcap">Orlando</span> flinch."</p>

<p>The beautiful girl admitted the force of this appeal and a renewed
scene of affectionate leave-taking took place. Suddenly the Ayah, who
up to this moment had been dozing in her arm-chair, rose, and holding
up a warning hand said, "Hist!"</p>

<p>We did so, alarmed by the impressive air of the good old nurse.</p>

<p>"Hist! What is that sound?"</p>

<p>I listened intently, and sure enough heard a faint tapping,
proceeding apparently from the floor under my feet.</p>

<p>"I suspect treachery," continued the Ayah hurriedly. "'Twas only
yester morn I saw <span class="smcap">Youbyoub</span> scowling at us
as we passed by on our early walk. Oh, beware, my lord, of
<span class="smcap">Youbyoub</span>."</p>

<p>This <span class="smcap">Youbyoub</span>, I ought to say, was the
young and bloodthirsty Prince of the Lozen Jehs, a tribe of wild
warriors from the north. Betrothed to the beautiful
<span class="smcap">Chuddah</span> at an early age, he naturally
viewed with hatred the advent of one on whom nature had bestowed her
favours so bountifully, and who was bound, therefore, to make himself
dear to <span class="smcap">Chuddah</span>. I knew he detested me, but
I had hitherto scorned him. I was now to discover my mistake.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the words left the Ayah's lips when a loud rumbling
made itself heard: the floor seemed to heave in one terrific crash,
there was a horrible explosion, and before I had time to realise what
had happened we three, <span class="smcap">Chuddah</span>, the Ayah
and I, were being propelled upwards into space at the rate of at least
a thousand miles an hour.</p>

<h2>TOYS' TALK.</h2>

<p class="titleit">(Being an unflattering Tale of Hope.)</p>

<p>"There's ingratitude for you," said the Rag Doll marked
"three-and-six."</p>

<p>"Where?" I asked, rousing myself from my meditation on my
tambourine and drumsticks.</p>

<p>She pointed to a figure which had just been placed in the
second row. He was dressed very smartly in a red coat trimmed with
tinsel. But he had an unmistakeable air of second-hand.</p>

<p>"I made that man," said the Rag Doll, "and now he cuts me dead
before them all! It's atrocious! Why, but for me he would have been
bought for five shillings, and would have been the property of the
plainest child in London."</p>

<p>"Not that," I pleaded; "think of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, very plain, anyhow. I was ready to bow to him. I almost
did."</p>

<p>"In fact, you did."</p>

<p>"I didn't. I declare I didn't."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, you didn't, then. It only looked like it."</p>

<p>"He first came here," said the Rag Doll, "three weeks ago. At that
time he was&mdash;quite presentable. He was everything he should be. He
stood firmly on his legs without toppling over, and had his cocked hat
firmly fixed on his head. And his sword&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where did he wear that?"</p>

<p>"He <i>carried</i> that, Mr. <span class="smcap">Whyte
Rabbit</span>. Don't be silly. Wore it by his side, you know, and had
epaulettes, too."</p>

<p>"He has changed outwardly at least."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; well, I did that. I took him in hand, and I just
taught him, and now&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. But how did you teach him?"</p>

<p>"I fell upon him. I knocked him from his perch, and in the fall
broke his wretched sword with my own weight!"</p>

<p>"What very arbitrary distinctions you draw!"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean. I do like a plaything to be smart,
anyhow. Don't you, Mr. <span class="smcap">Whyte Rabbit</span>? You
don't play your tambourine properly. Now I shall take you in hand."
And she slipped toward me.</p>

<p>"I prefer to use my own drumsticks. I can make enough noise in the
world without extraneous assistance."</p>

<p>"How silly you are. I don't want to see you spick and span, as if
you were ready to be given away with a pound of tea."</p>

<p>"Still, I don't see why I should alter my drumming&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you are stupid! Of course you admire me!"</p>

<p>"As he did. I see."</p>

<p>"You seem to think that very funny."</p>

<p>"Not a bit."</p>

<p>"Then we are agreed. There is not much fun in our talk."</p>

<p>"You're always so observant. There is not. Short sentences."</p>

<p>"And a <i>soup&ccedil;on</i> of the unexpressed."</p>

<p>"Which means so very much. When understood?"</p>

<p>She swayed from one side to the other. There was an easterly wind
blowing full from the open north door of the Arcade. I looked unhappy.
There is an understanding that I shall look unhappy except when I am
beating my tambourine with my drumsticks.</p>

<p>"What was I saying before&mdash;before you&mdash;you know&mdash;oh, about our
talk, of course, being rather flat and not very profitable?"</p>

<p>"I have no more to say," said I.</p>

<p>"But he was very angry, for in my fall I broke his nose."</p>

<p>"I have a bad nose, too."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with your nose?" asked the Rag Doll smiling.</p>

<p>"The joint is injured and some of the fur has come off my head&mdash;in
fact, I am as bald as the ball of an eighteen-penny bagatelle-board,"
and I contrived (with the assistance of the draught) to roll away a
little.</p>

<p>"You find carriage exercise good for your poor nose?" bubbled the
Rag Doll.</p>

<p>Now when the Rag Doll bubbles&mdash;an operation which includes a sudden
slipping down the shelf, the lighting up of glass eyes, a dart of a
kid-covered arm with vague fingers, and a gurgling gust of slipping
drapery&mdash;I am in the habit of ceasing to argue the question.</p>

<p>"Well, your fall will not damage the machinery. You have nothing to
do but look&mdash;you understand. While I have to beat my tambourine with
my drumsticks."</p>

<p>"But I won't fall upon you. I reserved my weight for the warrior
that was once valued at five shillings and is now reduced to
half-a-crown."</p>

<p>"Because you&mdash;educated him?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And now he cuts me dead! Why he will be bought by some one
with poorer means, and will be all the more appreciated."</p>

<p>"Of course you did not care for the impoverished soldier?"</p>

<p>"Not a little bit."</p>

<p>"Nor any one else?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then I repeated the question several times in such a way that if
written a line of space would be given to every query. It was a notion
of <span class="smcap">Alexandre Dumas</span> <i>p√®re</i> to do the
same in his novels. And his sentences were worth a franc a line. At
least, so it has been related.</p>

<p>The Rag Doll looked straight in front of her.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg 83]</span></p>

<p>"Hullo, old chappie," I said to myself; "where did you spring
from?"</p>

<p>"Why, it's my proprietor!" said the Rag Doll, ceasing to bubble,
and becoming all propriety.</p>

<p>The toy merchant took no notice of what we had said. How could he
when our voices were inaudible? But he dusted us with his
feather-brush, and left us ready for another dialogue. For all that
the Rag Doll didn't think he was coming just then. No more did I.</p>

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="title1">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Tuesday, February 5.</i>&mdash;Almost thought just
now we were going to have another <span class="smcap">Bradlaugh</span>
business. House crowded; Members on all sides eager for the fray. At
the bar, closely packed, stood group of newly-elected Members. Seen
some of them here before. <span class="smcap">Broadhurst</span> back
again after what seems years of exile. <span class="smcap">Elliott
Lees</span>, deep in thought as to where he shall next go for his
groceries in Birkenhead, in centre of the group. The new
Solicitor-General, our old friend <span class="smcap">Frank
Lockwood</span>, like a tall maple (not Sir
<span class="smcap">Blundell</span>), lifts his head and smiles.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;"><a href="images/084-1.png"><img src="images/084-1-250.png" width="250" height="376" alt="Spoiling his Peroration" /></a>
<p class="center">Spoiling his Peroration</p>
</div>

<p>"Members desiring to take their seats will please come to the
table," says the <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Broadhurst</span>, in the van, sprang forward.
Had made a fair start when <span class="smcap">Henry James</span>,
watchful in aerie on corner bench below gangway, leaped to feet and
proposed to discuss the legality of situation. Objection founded on
abstruse mathematical problem. Two writs had been moved to fill
vacancies in the representation of Leicester. There had been only one
election. There should, <span class="smcap">Henry James</span> argued,
have been two. Consequently, election invalid; the two new Members for
Leicester not Members at all, only strangers, intruders across the
bar, liable to be whipped off in custody of Sergeant-at-Arms.</p>

<p>Here was a pretty prospect for opening of Session to which
<span class="smcap">Squire of Malwood</span> had come with his pocket
full of Bills! Sergeant-at-Arms glanced uneasily at
<span class="smcap">Broadhurst</span> retreating before interruption.
What if repetition of the old process were imminent? Were there to be
more carpet-dances on floor of House through summer afternoons, as was
the wont of Captain <span class="smcap">Gosset</span> pirouetting to
and from the Mace, House not quite sure whether he was clutching
<span class="smcap">Bradlaugh</span> or
<span class="smcap">Bradlaugh</span> him? Then the merry scenes in the
outer hall, <span class="smcap">Bradlaugh</span> fighting at long
odds, finally thrust down the staircase, breathless, his coat torn,
his stylographic pen broken. <span class="smcap">Broadhurst</span> a
stone or two lighter than <span class="smcap">Bradlaugh</span>. But
was he equally nimble-footed? Certainly he had not yet acquired the
practice which in the second Session of the controversy enabled
<span class="smcap">Bradlaugh</span> and the Sergeant-at-Arms to
advance, retire, <i>chasser</i>, and clasp hands across the middle, in
perfect time.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span></p>

<p>But a great deal has happened in the fifteen years that have sped
since, from a corner seat on the side of the House facing
<span class="smcap">Henry James</span>, <span class="smcap">Drummond
Wolff</span> rose, and with emphatic gesture barred
<span class="smcap">Bradlaugh's</span> progress to the table. By
striking coincidence that strange chapter in Parliamentary history,
opening by chance accident and leading to stirring consequences, was
finally closed this very night, when
<span class="smcap">Akers-Douglas</span> moved writ to fill vacancy
created in South Paddington by death of "Right Hon.
<span class="smcap">Randolph Henry Spencer Churchill</span>, commonly
called Lord <span class="smcap">Randolph Churchill</span>."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry James</span> had not concluded his
sentence when <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> interposed with
ruling that there must be no interference with Members desiring to
take their seats. So incident closed. Members for Leicester sworn in.
<span class="smcap">Broadhurst</span>, in exuberance of moment, made
as though he would publicly shake the hand the clerk held out to take
writ of return. But <span class="smcap">Reginald Francis Douce
Palgrave</span> not made K.C.B. for nothing. "The writ, the writ!" he
hoarsely murmured, waving back the friendly hand.
<span class="smcap">Broadhurst</span> hastily produced document from
breast-pocket, and thus fresh scandal was averted.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Address moved.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Exceptional interest in this afternoon's
proceedings in view of circumstance that <span class="smcap">Ellis
Ashmead-Bartlett</span> (Knight)&mdash;what was it
<span class="smcap">Grandolph</span> said about mediocrity with
double-barrelled names?&mdash;would appear in his new character as
<span class="smcap">Silomio</span>. Title conferred during recess by
delegates from Swaziland. Curiosity quickened by report that
<i>d&eacute;but</i> would be made in character. Yesterday we had mover
and seconder of Address in velvet suits with silver buttons and brands
Excalibur at their side. Why no <i>Silomio</i> in the native dress of
the nation that has adopted him? Some disappointment when he turned up
in ordinary frock-coat. Understood that weather responsible for this.
Swazi morning dress picturesque, but with nine degrees of frost in
Palace Yard a little inadequate, especially for a beginner.</p>

<p>Even in commonplace English dress
<span class="smcap">Silomio</span> made a striking figure as he stood
at the table, and belaboured it for "Swaziland, my Swaziland." Looked
at times as if he were going to leap over, and seize by the throat
<span class="smcap">Sydney Buxton</span> provokingly smiling on the
other side. Last week's handkerchief hanging out from his coat tail
pocket, in liberal measure though crumpled state, lent a weird effect
to back view, not interrupted by inconvenient crowding on front
Opposition Bench. Odd how <span class="smcap">Silomio's</span>
colleagues in late Ministry find business elsewhere when he rises to
orate.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Talking round Address.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Rather painful scene in House to-night.
<span class="smcap">Chaplin</span> resuming debate on Address led its
course gently by the still waters of bimetallism. Somehow that a
subject that has never quite entranced attention of frivolous Commons.
It works certain subtle spell upon them. At clink of sovereign and
shilling between argumentative finger and thumb they slink away. So it
was to-night whilst <span class="smcap">Chaplin</span> spoke. Faithful
among the faithless found was <span class="smcap">Jemmy
Lowther</span>. He sat attentive beside the orator with an expression
of profound wisdom, unmitigated by boyish habit of keeping his hands
in his trouser pocket, not without suspicion of furtively counting his
marbles or attempting to open his knife with the fingers of one
hand.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;"><a href="images/084-2.png"><img src="images/084-2-250.png" width="250" height="410" alt="A Trifle for the Unemployed!" /></a>
<p class="center">A Trifle for the Unemployed!</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jemmy</span> and
<span class="smcap">Chaplin</span> rank amongst oldest boys in the
school. One took his seat for mid-Lincolnshire in December, 1868; saw
the rise to supreme power of Mr. G. and, with some intervals, suffered
it up to the end. The other rode in triumphantly from York one July
day in 1865. Thus their united Parliamentary ages if fifty-seven, a
record hard to beat.  Shoulder to shoulder they have, through all this
time, resisted attacks on British Constitution. Now, suddenly,
publicly, in eye of the scorner, came sharp parting of the ways.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chaplin</span> viewing state of things
depressing industrial communities admitted it was very bad. Mills
closed, mines empty, ship-building yards silent, workmen starving.
Only one thing would save the State&mdash;Bimetallism. "Is there anyone,"
said the orator with magnificent wave of arm round desolate benches;
"who has any other suggestion to make for the salvation of these
industries?" Then up spoke <span class="smcap">Jemmy Lowther</span>.
"I have," he said with final tug at the blade of the knife hidden in
his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chaplin</span> stood aghast. Could it be
possible&mdash;his own familiar friend? He turned, looked down on him,
gasping for breath. Then in a hollow voice he added, "What has my
right hon. friend been doing all this time? Why doesn't he make his
proposal?"</p>

<p>Here was an opening for apology, recantation, or at least,
submissive silence. But <span class="smcap">Jemmy</span> evidently
gone to the bad; got the bit between his teeth and bolted. "I've made
it over and over again," he growled, thinking resentfully of his much
crying in the wilderness for that blessed thing Protection. Ribald
House roared with laughter. <span class="smcap">Chaplin</span>, cut to
heart, avoided repetition of painful incident by bringing oration to
early conclusion.</p>

<p>"Let's put this matter to practical test,
<span class="smcap">Toby</span>," he said. "Come along with me, and
we'll consult the Unemployed."</p>

<p>Not far to go. On Westminster Bridge a hollow-cheeked man leaning
over low wall stared at ice-floes silently gliding down with the tide.
"My good man," said <span class="smcap">Chaplin</span>, "you look
unemployed, and I daresay you're hungry. Now, in order to put you
straight, which would you rather have, Bimetallism or Protection?"</p>

<p>"Well, if you don't mind, master," said the Unemployed huskily,
"I'd like a chunk o' bread."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said <span class="smcap">Chaplin</span>, "these people are so
illogical." And he gave him half-a-crown.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Drifted into debate on Bimetallism. Business
can wait.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Squire of Malwood</span> left
sick room to take part in debate and division on
<span class="smcap">Jeffreys'</span> Amendment to Address.
Self-devotion dangerous on foggy, frosty night. But the result worth
it, at least for crowded House that heard the speech. Best thing of
the kind done in House since <span class="smcap">Dizzy's</span> prime.
